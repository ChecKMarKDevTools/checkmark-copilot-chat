# 🚀 How to Use Co2. **Extensions are powerful—use them responsibly!**
   Seriously, read [Security Principles](../.github/instructions/security-principles.instructions.md).lot in This Repo (and Actually Have Fun Doing It)

## 📦 Quickstart

1. **Install the Extension**
   One install. That’s it. No arcane rituals, no dependency hell.
   This Copilot/VS Code extension handles everything from docs to refactoring, with security baked right in.

2. **Pick a Chat Mode**
   Want docs? Use Doc Doctor.
   Need to review logs? Summon Logging Reviewr.
   Feeling lucky? Try one of the weird modes and see what happens.
   _Pro tip: Each mode comes with its own custom instructions and Easter eggs._

3. **Start Chatting**
   Hit the Copilot Chat button (or whatever shortcut you love).
   Use [implement-feature.prompt.md](../.github/prompts/implement-feature.prompt.md) to add features without ever wondering, “Wait, am I supposed to write tests?” (The answer is: Yes. Yes, you are.)

4. **Be Secure, Not Sorry**
   Seriously, read [SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md](../.github/instructions/security-principles.instructions.md).
   If you’re unsure, the answer is “sanitize input and add a comment.”
   All chat modes enforce security, but you’re still responsible for double-checking before merging.

## 🎭 Best Practices in Plain English

- **If you copy-paste Stack Overflow, check it for CVEs.**
- **Every function should tell a story.** If it doesn’t, rewrite until it does (bonus for puns).
- **No code or doc is too trivial to explain.** Pretend you’re teaching your future self, after - ree espressos and no sleep.
- **Give credit** to anyone who made you laugh, found your bug, or brought snacks to your standup.

## 🦹‍♀️ Security Isn’t Optional

- If you see a shortcut, ask yourself: _“Would this embarrass me in a code review?”_
- If you answered yes, you know what to do.
- Never log secrets, API keys, or how you _really_ feel about legacy code.

## 🕹️ Chat Modes (a.k.a. “How to Change the Channel”)

| Mode Name | What It Does | How to Use It |
| - | - | - |
| Doc Doctor 🩺 | Writes docs in every style except boring | `/chat doc` |
| Logging Reviewr 🔎 | Roasts your log statements, suggests fixes | `/chat logging` |
| Instruction Whisperer 🌬️ | Crafts repo-level instructions like a pro | `/chat instruct` |
| Refactor Genie 🧞 | Transforms code from ugly to elegant | `/chat refactor` |
| CI/CD Wizard 🪄 | Automates pipelines with magic (and YAML) | `/chat ci` |
| …and more coming! | | |

_Please, don’t be afraid to try them all. You can’t break it, and if you do, you’ve just found your place in the changelog._

## 🐛 Bug Reports, Feature Ideas & Feedback

- Open an issue, but don’t expect to be a contributor. (It’s not you, it’s us—see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).)
- If you have a killer idea, shout it out anyway. We’ll add credit in the docs, no question.
- For security issues, use the official process (or just send a very mysterious email to `human@checkmarkdevtools.dev`).

## 🦄 Final Notes

- No boring allowed. If you catch a boring section, PR a meme or a pop culture reference.
- Security, openness, and giving credit are **required**.
- Testers and users: you’re the real MVPs—thanks for making this extension better and keeping it fun.
