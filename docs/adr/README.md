# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records for the CheckMark Copilot Extension project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project, along with their context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: A short descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that prompted the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: The results of the decision

## Current ADRs

3. Fill in the sections
4. Submit as part of your PR
5. Update this index
