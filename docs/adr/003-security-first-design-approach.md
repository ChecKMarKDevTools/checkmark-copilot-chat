# ADR-003: Security-First Design Approach

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-07-21

## Context

VS Code extensions have privileged access to user workspaces, files, and potentially sensitive information. Chat-based extensions that interact with AI services introduce additional security vectors:

- User input validation and sanitization
- AI response filtering and validation
- Secure handling of workspace context
- Protection against prompt injection attacks
- Audit logging for security events
- Dependency security and supply chain protection

The extension will handle user code, documentation, and potentially sensitive project information, requiring a comprehensive security framework from the foundation.

## Decision

Implement a security-first design approach with multiple defense layers:

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

- Validate all user parameters and input
- Sanitize data before sending to external APIs
- Implement input length limits and format validation
- Prevent code injection through input validation

### 2. Multi-Layer Security Architecture

- **Input Layer**: Parameter validation and sanitization
- **Processing Layer**: Secure instruction loading and context handling
- **Output Layer**: Response filtering and validation
- **Audit Layer**: Security event logging

### 3. Secure Defaults

- Principle of least privilege for all operations
- Fail-safe error handling (deny by default)
- Secure configuration defaults
- Explicit user consent for sensitive operations

### 4. Supply Chain Security

- Dependency scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Automated security updates where safe
- Immutable build artifacts
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation

### 5. Audit & Monitoring

- Log security-relevant events
- Track usage patterns for anomaly detection
- Maintain audit trails for debugging
- Privacy-preserving telemetry

## Consequences

### Positive

- **User Trust**: Robust security builds confidence
- **Compliance Ready**: Meets enterprise security requirements
- **Attack Resistance**: Multiple layers prevent common attacks
- **Audit Trail**: Security events are trackable
- **Supply Chain Protection**: Dependencies are continuously monitored

### Negative

- **Development Overhead**: Security adds complexity to all features
- **Performance Impact**: Validation and logging add processing time
- **User Friction**: Some security measures may slow user interactions
- **Maintenance Burden**: Security updates require ongoing attention

### Trade-offs

- Chose security over development speed
- Chose user protection over feature simplicity
- Chose compliance readiness over minimal overhead

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Never Trust Input**: Validate and sanitize all user input
2. **Secure by Default**: All features start with secure configurations
3. **Fail Safely**: Errors should deny access, not grant it
4. **Log Security Events**: Track authentication, authorization, and suspicious activity
5. **Regular Security Reviews**: Periodic assessment of security posture

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Basic Input Validation Only**: Insufficient for enterprise use
2. **Post-Launch Security**: Retrofitting security is more expensive and risky
3. **External Security Service**: Added complexity and network dependencies
4. **User-Configurable Security**: Too many options, potential for misconfiguration
