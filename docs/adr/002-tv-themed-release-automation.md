# ADR-002: TV-Themed Release Automation

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-07-21

## Context

Traditional software release notes are often dry, technical, and forgettable. Development teams need release documentation that is:

- Memorable and engaging
- Professional but approachable
- Easy to categorize and understand
- Fun for the team to write and read

Our automated release system uses Release Please with conventional commits, requiring a structured approach to changelog generation that maintains consistency while adding personality.

## Decision

Implement TV-themed release automation where:

1. **Releases as Seasons**: Each major release becomes a "season"
2. **Features as Episodes**: Individual features become "episodes" with titles
3. **Bug Fixes as Bloopers**: Bug fixes are presented as "behind the scenes" content
4. **Breaking Changes as Plot Twists**: Major changes get dramatic treatment
5. **Entertainment References**: Use TV/movie references while maintaining professionalism

Example changelog structure:

```markdown
## Season 2: "The Documentation Chronicles" ðŸ“º

### New Episodes

- **S02E01**: "The Doc Doctor Arrives" - Comprehensive documentation generation
- **S02E02**: "Security Sentinel's First Case" - Advanced security scanning

### Behind the Scenes (Bug Fixes)

- Fixed chat mode parameter parsing in dramatic fashion
- Resolved extension activation timing issues

### Plot Twists (Breaking Changes)

- BREAKING: Chat command structure changed to parameterized format
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Memorable Releases**: Teams and users remember release content better
- **Engaging Documentation**: More likely to be read and shared
- **Team Morale**: Fun release process boosts team engagement
- **Brand Differentiation**: Unique approach stands out in marketplace
- **Easy Categorization**: Clear structure for different change types

### Negative

- **Cultural Sensitivity**: TV references may not translate globally
- **Professional Concerns**: Some organizations may prefer traditional formats
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Requires creativity for each release
- **Template Complexity**: More sophisticated automation templates needed

### Trade-offs

- Chose engagement over formality
- Chose memorability over traditional documentation
- Chose brand personality over conservative approach

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Technical Changelog**: Boring, easily ignored
2. **Game/Fantasy Themes**: Less universal than TV/entertainment
3. **No Theming**: Missed opportunity for engagement
4. **User-Configurable Themes**: Too complex for initial implementation
