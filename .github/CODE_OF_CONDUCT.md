# 🌈 Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Everyone using or talking about this project should feel welcome, safe, and able to ask any question—no matter how “obvious.”
No harassment, gatekeeping, or “RTFM”-style answers allowed.
If you’re being a jerk, you will get called out (with humor, but still).

## Reporting

If someone crosses the line (intentionally or not), reach out privately: `human@checkmarkdevtools.dev`.
We take this seriously, but we handle it like grown-ups (and with memes, if appropriate).

## Credit & Recognition

Good vibes, kindness, and creativity will get you shouted out in the docs.
If you’re awesome, you’ll know it.
