# 🌈 Code of Conduct

## ✍️ The Pledge

**If you are working on, using, contributing to, talking about, thinking about, lurking near, or just accidentally stumbled across this project—this pledge applies to you.**

No matter who you are, where you’re from, what you look like, who you love, what you believe, how you express yourself, what you do for fun, or how you got here - this space is radically inclusive, always open, and actively welcoming.

We don’t just tolerate differences; we celebrate them! We give credit, answer questions, call out awesome, and never, ever gatekeep.

**This is your space, too.** ❣️

## 🟠✨ Oompa Loompa Good Vibes & Recognition

This project runs on encouragement, respect, and a big dash of fun. Everyone - no matter your background, experience, timezone,

We give credit loudly, celebrate curiosity, and recognize every contribution (even the little ones, especially the big ones).

**Asking questions is always welcome - there are no dumb questions, just unexplored ones.**

RTFM answers, sarcasm, or gatekeeping are not cool. If someone takes the time to ask, that means they’re trying to learn. Help each other out, always.

If you see someone doing something awesome, call it out!

Drop Oompa Loompa-level kudos, memes, high-fives, or whatever your good-vibes style is. We thrive on positive feedback and *recognize all the helpers* - publicly and often.

## 🔥 The Big Red Line (Boundaries & Zero Tolerance)

**If you cross the line, you’re getting called out. No sugarcoating, no soft landings - don’t expect a joke and I won't pretend it didn't happen. This is your only warning.**

> 🦄 **Personal Disclaimer (from Ashley):**
> I can be understanding about a lot of things - life happens, we're all different, and sometimes I let stuff slide. But **THIS?**
>
> **Discrimination, harassment, bullying, or hate of any kind?** I do not tolerate it in any form, nor will I stand by and watch, hear, or read it happen - no matter the channel 🗣️, space 💬, meeting 🖥️, call 📞, or corner of the internet 🌐. If you’re a contributor here, you’re accountable everywhere.
>
> That means:
> - **Race** 🏳️‍🌈🧑🏿‍🦱🎭
> - **Religion** ⛪🕍🕌
> - **Country of origin** 🌎🗺️🧭
> - **Sexual or non-sexual affinity** 💞🌈🦋
> - **Gender identity or expression** ⚧️🚻🦸‍♀️
> - **Age** 👶🧑‍🦳🧒
> - **Hobbies** 🎨🏄‍♂️🎮
> - **Height, weight, speed, style, whatever** 🏃‍♂️🪩🦒🦦👠
>
> **If you can't contribute as a decent human being, you’re out. Period. Permanently.**
>
> If I see it, hear it, or smell it, I will **report you, flag you 🚩, and if necessary, hang a bright, giant, flashing, neon, screaming sign above your head** so everyone knows exactly what kind of person you are — if that’s what it takes to get you out of my space, permanently.
> *And honestly? This is me being as nice as I’m ever going to be about it.*
