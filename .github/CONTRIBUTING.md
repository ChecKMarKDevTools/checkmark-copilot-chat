# 🤝 Contributing to CheckMark Copilot Extension

First off, thanks so much for your interest in making this project better!
I’m all about transparency, openness, and sharing what I learn - but at this time, I’m **not accepting outside contributions** for the Copilot extension.

This isn’t a forever thing!
Right now, it’s a one-person show as I work on making the extension as secure, stable, and delightful as possible. Once things settle down, I fully plan to open things up for feedback, ideas, and (eventually) code contributions.

## So, What Can You Do Right Now?

- **Try it out!** Your feedback matters—seriously, I read every DM and GitHub Issue.
- **Open issues** for bugs, feature requests, or just to say hi. You _will_ be credited for your idea if it makes it in.
- **Watch the repo** for frequent updates, and check back soon! I’ll make a LOT of noise when contributor spots open up.

## Why the Hold?

Security and privacy are core to this project. I need to make sure every piece is safe for users, and that the codebase is actually friendly for new folks when the gates open. Think of this as “season one” - the cameos and guest stars are coming soon.

## Thanks Again

> I appreciate your enthusiasm and can’t wait to welcome contributors in the near future. Until then, keep an eye out for updates, memes, and maybe a surprise or two.
> — Ashley (just me for now!) 🦄
