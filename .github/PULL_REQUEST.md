# ðŸš¦ Pull Requests Not Accepted (For Now!)

Thanks for your interest in improving the CheckMark Copilot Extension!
Right now, Iâ€™m not accepting outside pull requests while I get everything stable and secure.
This is a solo project for the moment, but **check back soonâ€”contributors will be welcomed as soon as the gates open!**

- Found a bug? Open an [issue](../issues) instead, and youâ€™ll get full credit if itâ€™s fixed.
- Have a feature idea? Please share it via an issue - I do read them all (eventually).

> ðŸ¦„ Thanks again for your enthusiasm, patience, and positive energy!
> â€” Ashley (just me for now)
