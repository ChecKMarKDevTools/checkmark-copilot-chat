# 🛡️ Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue or vulnerability, **please do not open a public GitHub issue**.
Instead, send a detailed email to `human@checkmarkdevtools.dev` (yes, it’s checked!).
Include:

- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Potential impact
- Your contact info (so I can give you credit and say thanks)

## What Happens Next?

- I’ll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours (unless the server melts).
- Verified issues will be triaged ASAP.
- You’ll get credit in the release notes if you want it—snacks or memes also accepted as thanks.

## Project Security Commitments

- All dependencies scanned regularly for CVEs
- No hardcoded secrets—ever
- Security best practices followed in code and docs ([see here](./instructions/security-principles.instructions.md))

Thank you for helping keep this project safe for everyone!
