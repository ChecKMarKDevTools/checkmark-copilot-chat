# CheckMark Copilot Extension 🦾🤖🛡️

A “just install it and go” VS Code + Copilot extension that’s actually fun to use.
You get docs, logging, automation, and code review magic-served with security, snark, and a few TV Easter eggs.

## 🦄 What Does This Extension Do?

- **Custom Copilot Chat Modes:** Docs, logging, refactoring, and CI/CD—each with its own twist (and sometimes attitude).
- **One-click Setup:** Install, configure, get out of your own way.
- **Security First:** All code and features are designed to be safe, open, and 100% transparent.
- **Zero Contributor Drama:** Feedback is gold, but code changes are closed (for now).

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Install the Extension** (from the VS Code marketplace or side-load—docs coming soon!)
2. **Pick Your Mode:**
   - _Doc Doctor_ for docs
   - _Logging Reviewr_ for logs
   - _Instruction Whisperer_ for repo rules
   - _Refactor Genie_ for cleanup
   - …or just try `/chat help` to see them all!
3. **Chat With Copilot:**
   Use [implement-feature.prompt.md](./.github/prompts/implement-feature.prompt.md) for new features. All instructions are written for real people—no robotspeak.

---

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

- Never trust user input—validate everything.
- No hardcoded secrets (no, not even “just for testing”).
- All dependencies scanned for known vulnerabilities.
- Read the full [Security & Design Best Practices](.github/instructions/SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.instructions.md) for your AI rulebook.

If you find a security issue, please **don’t open a public issue**—email `human@checkmarkdevtools.dev` and you’ll get a response fast (plus credit and good karma).
